# MemoirStack
An online portal to stack up your memories and retrieve them anytime, anywhere. Made using ReactJS [v 16.12], Redux [v 4.0.5], MongoDB [v 1.35.0], ExpressJS [v 4.18] and MaterialUI (Core) [v 4.12].

Directions to make it work: - Just run "npm install" in both client and server directories so as to install the required modules. Rest will work as expected.
